       "['for computer enthusiast, MaxPC is a welcome sight in your mailbox. i can remember for years savorying every page of \"boot\" (as it was called in beginning) as i was (and still am) obcessed with PC\\'s. Anyone, from advanced users - to beginners looking for knowledge - can profit from every issue of MaxPC. the icing on the cake is the subscription that comes with a CD-ROM as it is packed with demos, utilities, and other useful apps (very helpful for those not blessed with broadband connections). Until I discovered the community of hardware enthusiast web sites, MaxPC, formerly \"boot\", was my only really informative source for computing news and articles. To this day, i consider my subscription to it worth more than 10 subscriptions to most other computing mags. I can\\'t wait until they merge with DVD media and maybe end up offering more info on Divx codecs, encoding your own movies, and best bang for the buck audio and video equipment. Try a few issues (with CD)and you may get hooked...',\n",
       " 'Thank god this is not a Ziff Davis publication.  MaxPC will actually tell you if a product is bad. They will print just what they think about something; no sugar coating. I would compare their style to Car and Driver. Technical, but they know how to have a good time.',\n",
       " 'Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare pictures, and other items of similar nature. It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\\n\\nThis magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\\n\\nAntiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn\\'t very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\\n\\nThe writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I\\'m afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don\\'t bother reading because most of the material doesn\\'t keep my interest.\\n\\nOverall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.',\n",
       " 'This beautiful magazine is in itself a work of art. The quality of every page and bits of information is fascinating. I see the art, the homes and read every word including the ads.

That makes it very easy to read while at the same time it is imparting in-depth technical know-how.\\n\\n If you are a newbie, in no time you possess expert knowledge of computers and, to an extent, of electronics.\\n\\nIf you are already advanced, then you get even more advanced. Period.\\n\\nAs an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.\\n\\nFor instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.\\n\\nYou become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.\\n\\nThere are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!\\n\\nI also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.\\n\\nThere are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.\\n\\nYou also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.\\n\\nOverall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.\\n\\nI have the kindle for Ipad version, and it is the absolute best. Better than the Maximum PC app itself that doesn't really work.\",\n",

Maximum PC, PC Gamer and Computer Shopper were required reading for me in my early years of computer building and upgrading.\\n\\nFast forward many years later and I finally let me subscription lapse and never renewed. Chalk it up to the immediacy of the Internet and all the new hardware sites that left me wondering why I would need to read information 2-3 months out of date.\\n\\nHowever, on a recent business trip I picked up a newsstand copy for the flight and was struck at how much I enjoyed reading good content again. And to the writers credit, they have changed content slightly to highlight articles that do not suffer from a few months delay.\\n\\nI work in a circulation department for another magazine and I get all the frustration magazine customers have at slow delivery, fulfillment of old issues and all those many many ads. My only defense is where else can you get an hour (or so) entertainment for 42 cents a month? Even double that price is still an insanely low price for such quality content.\\n\\nI\\'m glad I\\'m back on board after all these years. Sure I have the Internet for the day 1 reviews of new hardware launches and 10 page articles on tweaks to get 1 FPS more out of Skyrim but truthfully my patience for that type of involvement with my computer has dropped considerably.

The most obvious solution, click the \"stop auto-renew\" button does absolutely nothing except take you to the top of the page. WOW. Thank God I was able to return to the top of the page.  But Wait, that\\'s not your only option: you can also click the \"cancel subscription\" button.  It, too, takes you to the top of the page. Ah-ha, we have a pattern here.  At the top of the page is a sentence stating that you must call a certain phone number to cancel or change subscriptions. So those two buttons are... the modern day racing stripes for a web site with no function at all, mererly appearance? But this slick, digital interface Will help you utilize their 130 year old technology to stop your subscription. I knew the 19th and 20th centuries would be exciting, and that webpage is certainly the cat\\'s pajamas.\\n  I guess I\\'ll just stop all auto-renewals rather than get all pissed off and going on a rant each time.\\nAgain, the magazine is good for a lot of people.

The articles are generally substandard. They are usually poorly written or can't seem to get the facts straight. Their only saving grace is that they are so short (which is a problem when you run across the occasionally well-done, interesting article).

And guess what? Even for those who do not game, learning about cutting edge gaming technology can be applicable, because more often than not, that processor, GPU, or other piece of hardware has dozens, hundreds, or more uses besides merely gaming. I myself only game on occasion, and nothing that is demanding.

I'm no 'tree-hugger' but I prefer to cut down on paper and clutter, and cut down on the stuff I end up throwing in the trash.  I have an Android tablet on which I read a lot of things now, and I'd love to be able to subscribe to Maximum PC in a digital-only version, but it appears that is not something that is available.  For a magazine that is cutting-edge, you'd think they'd have it available.  The lack of a digital-only subscription is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

Chances are if you are thinking about getting this magazine you already have a smartphone, tablet pc, or other device that will let you read the website for free.\\n\\nThe other thing to think about is that the information you are reading in this months magazine is more than a month old. For example, in this month's issue they were raving about the Intel's Sandy Bridge chipset. Last month this was important information. However, today it is more important that Intel just announced flaws in the Sandy Bridge chipset and has issued a recall.\\n\\nFinally, many of the gear review articles have a flavor to them that seem like they are just paid puff pieces from the manufacturer.

       " 'Hi! This is a good magazine. I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it\\'s those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.\\nNow, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.\\nNow, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven\\'t finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven\\'t finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, \"when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue.\" Now, this is B.S. They are holding back on my last 2 issues that I paid for until they receive my payment. What if I did NOT want to renew this magazine? Does this mean I do not get my last 2 issues (Oct. & Nov. 2010) that I paid for? This is not fair business practices!!! They are still obligated to still send me my last 2 issues regardless if I renew or not. I am a little angered here. Yes, I like the magazine for obvious reasons and I will renew; but this is not fair at all! This is some deceptive marking trick to keep you subscribed and keep you paying to receive all your issues you already paid for!',\n",

Why did he say that?  Because there were 4 articles on being gay or the wonderful rich feeling that comes with being gay.  Uhhhhh, ok.  I just wanted to know how to dress nice.  For example, Tom Ford writes that if your straight you must sleep with a member of the opposite sex at least once in your life and then proceeds to call you a dunderhead if you don\\'t. Ok, fine, I get that, it\\'s an opinion by a fashion designer. But then a couple pages later there\\'s a huge article written by the mag itself about \"the rise of the alpha-gay\".

I find almost all the bass transcriptions way beyond my ability, but that probably only shows my lack of skill. I don't know how some reviewers state that the magazine is good for beginners, everything seems just beyond my reach, and I have been successfully playing bass in a cover band for years.

If I could actually play some of those transcriptions, maybe I would feel more positive about it. But Bass Player typically picks songs with complicated bass lines that are beyond my ability. If you can play complicated extended 16th note bass lines, there is probably some good material there.\\n\\nBass Player is an OK magazine, but I wish there was an alternative.

       " 'Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\\n\\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\\n\\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\\n\\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don\\'t like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\\n\\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn\\'t bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one\\'s perspective.\\n\\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don\\'t know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don\\'t know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\\n\\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don\\'t necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It\\'s all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.',\n",

       " \"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\\n\\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\\n\\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\\n\\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.\",\n",

Much of the software is somewhat dated by the time you get it and most if not all if it is available for download on the Internet (and you usually get newer versions).\\n\\nIf you're really into games, then the CD might be a good choice thanks to the game demos (which can be sizable downloads) but as far as the other stuff is concerned, it's mostly worthless.\\n\\nSave yourself the expense and get the subscription without the CD (which Amazon doesn't seem to offer - but it does exist).

Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.\\n\\nThere are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC\\'s and PC components, a \"Watchdog\" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an \"Ask the Doctor\" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.\\n\\nMy favorite is the how-to\\'s in just about every issue.  All of the how-to\\'s show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a \"write down to the lowest level\" nor a \"technogeek know-it-all\" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many \"secrets\" you won\\'t read in mainstream computer magazines.\\n\\nAnd the reviews.  I love the \"Kick-A**\" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn\\'t meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.\\n\\nThis product is managed by the same people who do \"PC Gamer\" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.\\n\\nTheir writing style isn\\'t for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.\\n\\nRecommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.

Many PC magazines have evolved into field-specific narrow-ranged reads, but this one stays true.  It covers software, hardware, modding, gaming, and so much more.  It features content appropriate for all levels of computer users, and its reviewers are phenomenally in-depth.  Not only is the content great, but reading it proves to be remarkably enjoyable.  The magazine\\'s staff succeeds in making it seem very personal, to such a level that you feel like you know everyone there.

If I ever need to know how to do something, I just go back to my Maximum PC library and select the issue that covers that topic.\\nAlso each issue has a section where the PC techies take a new product and test it under hazardous conditions to see whether it survives or not.  3 issues ago, techies took 4 USB \"keychain\" drives and tested them in 4 ways:  Dropped them from a 5-story building, put each one in a block of ice, in a clothes drier and put each one under the tires of a semi-truck.  At the end, they let you know which usb drive survived and which didn\\'t.\\nThis magazine covers much, much more.  However, I do not want to repeat other reviewers.  Great magazine!',\n",

If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag.

Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail.

I have to admit that the article on building your own super PC made me want to do just that, although I would opt for the budget version, which they also included in the article.

While many of the well-known players in this field (especially the ones with \"PC\" in their name) have dedicated increasing portions of their magazines to business-related topics, Maximum PC has stayed true to the cause of helping the individual home enthusiast or expert get the most from his machine. If you want to read about B2B apps, corporate firewalls, or XML, look elsewhere, but if you want comprehensive reviews of the latest hardware and software written for people who don\\'t need a tutorial to rename a file on their PC or insert a chart into an Excel file, look no further.\\nIf you\\'re the sort of person who builds his own machine or is thinking of doing so, Maximum PC will likely prove itself useful to you. Likewise for those planning to do their own hardware upgrades. And if you\\'re like me and just like to stay aware of and knowledgeable about current products and technologies then this is still an excellent and informative read.\\nTo be fair, there are a few features that may be displeasing to some readers. The writing is occasionally glib with a tendency towards sophomoric humor. There\\'s also a fair amount of focus on gaming, particularly 3D gaming technology. And the overriding theme of much of the magazine is maximizing the speed, power, and coolness of your machine.

The writers pull no punches about saying exatcly what they fell about certain companies and somtimes you get the felling that thee own some stock in certain companies!\\n  But in all the hardware reviews (which is the main focus of the magazine) are very interesting and they give you more than enough details and benchmarks to help you choose your hardware.',\n",

It covers specialized PC modifications (Specialty paint jobs, lights, windows, panels, conversions, etc), hardware issues, love/hate issues with new PCs and products on the market and so much more!\\nThis magazine is also a lot more easy-going on a language level than a lot of other PC magazines.

But, Lite-On doesn\\'t advertise in Maximum PC like Maximum\\'s Plextor benefactors.  Also, Asus Tek has been making a GeForce3 video card with video capture capabilities for several months now...seems more \"Maximum\" than the plain old \"gaming\" video cards they cream over (literally perfect 10 ratings).

This issue features \"starlets\" that you\\'ve never heard of naked!  This issue has our worthless best of lists crammed with products from the brands that gave our editors the most free loot!  Don\\'t even get me started on the fluffy features with celebrities who I don\\'t care about or the annoying how-to section.  In a world of independant beauty blogs that aren\\'t afraid to trash a product,  Youtube channels owned by pro-makeup artists,  and skincare sites run by practicing dermatologists,  Allure seems like a waste of paper and good money.',\n",
       " 'As a typical young female, I\\'ve read a lot of different magazines geared toward women. Most, in general, feature the same articles month after month, and therefore become repetitive and boring.  Let\\'s face it: there is only so much you can take reading about \"The Best Bedroom Moves\" issue after issue.  Allure, however, never seems dull or filled with useless amounts of recycled information.\\n\\nI began subscribing to the magazine at age 18 (I\\'m 23 now) and have never been disappointed.  Allure has articles for every age, and I find relevant information for my life, body, and health, and then I am able to find information that will interest and benefit my 50+ year old mother.  Perhaps that is part of the appeal of the magazine: any age group can enjoy it.  Not many magazines can say that.\\n\\nUnlike many other female-geared magazines, Allure offers more than just underwear pictures and \"how to please your man\" articles.  Each issue, Allure has an entire section dedicated to new health science discoveries, such as new updates about skin cancer and sleep problems. The magazine seems genuinely about women, beauty, and health, whereas other magazines make some feminists role their eyes (\"how to please your man,\" anyone?)\\n\\nLike anything else, Allure has its downfalls.  While I do appreciate the make-up, weightloss, and fashion tips, I still always feel that I can never quite live up to the expectation the magazine presents me.  I\\'m a pretty girl in good physical health, and I still- at times- feel inadequate when reading the many awesome articles of this magazine.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend Allure highly to women of all ages, shapes, and sizes.

The content, however, is short on how-to and long on buy-this-product. Much of the makeup is expensive and exclusive, unavailable to the majority of the buying public. They\\'re constantly raving over products that are quite frankly terrible, to the point where seeing Allure recommend something actually makes me less likely to try it. The fashion spreads are pointless and would be better left out, focusing on expensive items, unwearable trends, or flash-in-the-pan fads. The \"Makeup Colors\" technique is always frustrating, as the listed products never even resemble the actual look achieved. This problem is worsened by the fact that the colors of featured products rarely render true on the pages; I get sick of buying a cosmetic product only to find the color looks nothing like the way it looked on the page. It swings wildly between trends and recommendations with no apparent sense of coherence to it; its advice frequently contradicts itself from one month to the next. Finally, its focus on fluffy celebrity, name brand clothes, and rich-and-famous lifestyles (it\\'s obsessed with recommending clothes and etiquette for red-carpet \"parties\" of the kind I can\\'t begin to relate to) leads the average reader to develop a massive inferiority complex.\\n\\n Skip this one and go for Lucky for versatile fashion advice, the most important makeup tips and trends, and a wider range of ages, hairstyles, and races on the models than the bland-beautiful-young-white-girl Allure favors.',\n",
       " \"I don't currently have a subscription but I did have one for about 2 years when I was first getting into cosmetology. Allure is nice in that it isn't quite as varied on it's topics as the other magazines. They often have more beauty & hair related articles than other magazines and I like that about them. I really like how in just about every issue they have these Beauty 101, or Hair 101 cards that you can save to tell you how to do a manicure or do your hair a certain way. It's a nice little bonus. I did buy a few issues recently (April & May 04) and they were still including them. I do plan on subscribing again when I get the chance.

       " 'Unlike the other major fashion/beauty magazines which put fashion first and beauty a distant second, the focus of \"Allure\" is 90% beauty, 10% fashion.  In fact, \"Allure\" could dispense with the fashion section entirely; the clothes aren\\'t interesting and the photo layout for the clothes is just plain dull.  And the monthly article on an acting/recording star is a waste of space.  But the makeup section and the beauty tips are great.  One of my favorite sections is the Directory, which features top beauty salons in major cities around the country.  For the past year \"Allure\" has also run a monthly makeover section featuring two women who underwent a year-long makeover mostly dedicated to losing weight and shaping up; the subjects are women readers can identify with.  \"Allure\" is one of the few fashion/beauty magazines to regularly feature models of all ethnic groups in their editorial pages with makeup shades that look good on women of every shade from ebony to ivory.  One of \"Allure\"\\'s greatest strengths is that they don\\'t pander to any makeup company or brand; they are upfront about what works and what doesn\\'t.  They have also run some serious articles about the pluses and negatives of cosmetic surgery and the risks involved.

Although the content is still fairly good, the magazine is now very thin, and includes much less information that is worth reading.

Some of the pages were cut improperly so that parts of articles were missing. This occured several times through the year.

Each issue includes articles about friends and family, gardening, interior design, building, family matters, food, health, and shopping. This is the magazine I reach for between work and errands because the articles are easy to read and brief yet interesting and inspiring. A few feature examples: window box herbs, dieting myths, cooking scones, what's new in family cars, and more. Better Homes also emphasizes family by incorporating activities for children or for the whole family from season to season. Better Homes is a good magazine for holiday ideas, too, with recipes and crafts to decorate your home and enjoy with your children. Although there are more sophisticated home magazines out there, I'm glad I have Better Homes lying around when I have a minute to relax.\",\n",

But there must be some reason it is still around, despite the competition.  ARTnews is a quick read, lots of things happemn between its coevers, and it seems to be of more interest to working artsts than to the big gun collectors and museums.

The November 2001 for instance, has fashion design, with 3 articles on art/fashion, and one on Mary McFadden\\'s sculpture collection. It also has \"The New Climate\", about art after 9/11, from a response by several artists to the loss of a 100 million $ in art.\\nAlso included is a large section on new art books, and the obligatory \"avante garde\" piece. There are too many \"shock art\" articles in this magazine for my taste, therefore 4 instead of 5 stars, but I guess some people still consider this a \"trend\".\\nGood quality paper, excellent color reproduction, and the wide range of art represented make this a useful magazine for both artist and collector.',\n",

This is my warning, not noted in the above price/issues per year info. When I subscribed, you got 10 issues per year. As of now (Feb 2017) they only publish 8 issues per year. Magazine is dying, trying to keep itself afloat. Also they send out offers for handyman books. If you do not return the invoice cancelling the shipment, the book will be sent and then you either pay or have to deal with shipping it back. If you just toss the notice as junk mail you will be surprised when the book shows up. I will not be renewing when it is time, since I can check it out at my local library or read online through various apps.\\n\\nOne last gripe. The topic of some articles is beyond the scope of this type of magazine. This is geared toward homeowners, not professional contractors. But in the current issue(March 2017) there is an article starting on page 24  and goes to page 31 title Best Pro Tips Avoid Framing Tips.

       " 'Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages mostly in the middle to upper income groups\\n\\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines One difference is the departments Most magazines have departments but instead of talking about the same things each month these departments vary in their content the only exceptions being Know Tell and the The Details Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next but with different subtitles helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be\\n\\nAs far as the writing goes Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine Yes it is generally focused on things of interest to men but it covers a very broad range of interests You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty raising kids buying a new coat setting up an internet business breaking up with a girlfriend or purchasing the best vodka There are articles geared toward single men and married men as well as younger men and middle aged men\\n\\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details It is common to find eye catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more This is nothing new and most every magazine does this But the problem is that many of these eye popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them Take for example an article in a recent issue On the front it reads Is Your Wife a Bad Mom It sound like an engaging intellectual read But once you find the article and take in its 1000 words you quickly discover that there is little or no substance Basically it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings That is it There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally dont like to be called incompetent by their husbands Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment\\n\\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt It is common to find several four letter words in many of the articles and while this doesnt bother me at all I know that some readers will consider it too raw too edgy and too explicit Details writers have no problem telling it like it is and this can be both good and bad depending on ones perspective\\n\\nBesides the language some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers namely the Anthropology page at the end This closing article is meant to be humorous but some readers will not see it that way I dont know if it has always been this way but what Anthropology does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question Gay or  For example I have seen titles like Gay or Best Friends Gay or Cowboy Gay or Neo Punk Rocker and others With each of these there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one Basically it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress look and act makes them gay I find this silly and immature but I can see how some readers would find it insulting I dont know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed\\n\\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine They cover products like liquor cars electronics cigarettes fragrance etc Even though this magazine covers lots of different things the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else And each issue often has its own unique smell thanks to all of the cologne samples You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne\\n\\nOverall I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine I like some of the articles on food drink politics and the like But I dont necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting This magazine is deserving of only about two and one half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation Some will like this magazine and some will not Its all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope',\n",
