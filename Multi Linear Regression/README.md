# Multi Linear Regression

Problem 1: Toyota Corolla, Price prediction

Problem 2: Startup Data, Profit Prediction

## Toyota Corolla, Price prediction

* Performing EDA
    ```
    1. Features to work with: [Price, Age, KM,	HP,	cc,	Doors, Gears, Quarterly Tax, Weight]
    2. Checking Descriptive Statistics
    3. One Hot Encoding on categorical data 
    ```
* Visualizing Data

* Modeling with complete data

* Evaluating r-squared error
    ```
    We get r-square value of 0.86
    ```
* Checking Assumptions of Linear Regression
    ```
    1.Linear Relationship
    2.Multivariate Normal
    3.No Multicollinearity
    4.No Autocorrelation
    5.Homoscedasticity
    ```
* Checking High Influence points
* Improving model by removing high influence points
    ```
    One high influence point detected
    ```
## Startup Data, Profit Prediction

* Performing EDA
    ```
    1. Features to work with: [R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State, Profit]
    2. Checking Descriptive Statistics
    3. One Hot Encoding on categorical data 
    ```
* Visualizing Data

* Modeling with complete data

* Evaluating r-squared error
    ```
    We get r-square value of 0.95
    ```
* Checking Assumptions of Linear Regression
    ```
    1.Linear Relationship
