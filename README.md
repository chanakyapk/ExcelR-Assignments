# Problem Statement

Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 
3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and obtain 
optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data 
(class column we have ignored at the begining who shows it has 3 clusters)df


## Steps

- EDA
- Visualizing
- Scaling Data
- Clustering without PCA
```
Hierarchical Clustering
KMeans Clustering
```
- Clustering with PCA
```
Hierarchical Clustering
KMeans Clustering
```
- Visualizing Clusters with plotly in 3d
```
Obtained same results as without PCA with just 3 PCA components
